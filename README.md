# Bradley's Dotfiles

ðŸŽ© Inspired by [The Primeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles)

This repository houses public dotfiles that I like to apply to my dev envs.

ðŸ’¡ If you use my [Ansible](https://github.com/bradleygore/ansible) playbook, these can be auto-applied and dependencies installed for you ðŸ˜Ž
